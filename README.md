## Introduction
Our analysis examines residential water consumption and production across California's hydrologic regions. Using water supply and demand datasets, we investigated the total residential water consumed and produced in each region. This research highlights critical disparities in water usage, providing valuable insights for sustainability and resource planning.

## Key Findings

### **Consumption vs. Production**
- **San Joaquin River**: The region has the highest water consumption, significantly outstripping production capacity.
- **Other Regions**: North Coast, Colorado River, and Central Coast show much lower levels of both consumption and production.

### **Consumption-to-Production Ratios**
- **San Joaquin River**: Over 80:1, indicating a heavy reliance on external water resources.
- **Sacramento River**: Balanced ratio, demonstrating better alignment between consumption and local production.

## Process

### **Steps Taken**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Ensured consistency in metrics and filtered incomplete records.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Used bar charts and maps to identify trends and disparities.
3. **Focus Adjustments**:
   - Highlighted extreme consumption in regions like San Joaquin River and localized insights through station mapping.
4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Emphasized regional variation and calculated consumption-to-production ratios.

### **Tools Used**
- **Power BI**: For visualization and analysis.
- **Logarithmic Scales**: To improve clarity in regional comparison.

## Challenges
- **Data Disparities**: Required advanced visualization techniques, like log scales, for clarity.
- **Missing Data**: Limited comprehensive analysis for some regions.

---

## Recommendations
1. **Targeted Resource Planning**:
   - High-consumption regions, such as San Joaquin River, should reduce reliance on external sources by investing in recycling and conservation.
2. **Enhanced Data Collection**:
   - Uniform metrics across regions are essential for consistent, actionable insights.
3. **Public Awareness Campaigns**:
   - Water-saving initiatives should be promoted through education and incentive programs in high-consumption areas.

## Conclusion
Our findings underscore the need for improved water management policies, infrastructure investments, and public engagement to address California's water usage imbalances. Regional sustainability depends on bridging consumption-production gaps and fostering efficient resource use.
