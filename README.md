# Analytics For Good: Water Quality and Conservation in San Diego

## Overview
This repository hosts all the files and progress reports for the project "Water Quality and Conservation in San Diego." The project explores water usage and quality trends to develop actionable, data-driven solutions for sustainable water management. Our team leverages advanced analytics and visualization techniques to uncover insights and propose meaningful recommendations.

## Objectives
- Analyze water consumption patterns in San Diego.
- Evaluate the correlation between water quality and usage.
- Propose sustainable water management solutions based on data-driven insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Integration:** Combining and cleaning multiple datasets to ensure comprehensive and cohesive analysis.
- **Visual Dashboards:** Interactive visualizations of water quality trends, consumption patterns, and drought severity created using R Studio and Power BI.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Forecasting future water demand and understanding correlations with water quality.
